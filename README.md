Use of historical golf scoring data for predictive analysis: 
- Build predictive models for professional golf (US PGA & European Tour) events using privately curated datasets with features engineered to represent form going into a contest

Golf is a very difficult sport to make predictions on due to a number of factors:
- **Large number of players:** Field sizes vary from 30-156 players per event
- **Weather:** Sun, wind and rain all play a big role in scoring.  Tournaments are played over 4 days with the weather constantly changing 
- **Variety of course setups:** Links / parkland / length / grass types / rough length / green speed etc.
- **Variety of locations:** Tournaments are played all over the world with different climates and conditions affecting players differently
- **Player form:** All professional players go through several peaks and troughs in their career.  These are very difficult to predict and a professional golfer can go from hero-to-zero and visa versa for no apparent reason
- **Luck:** The bounce of the ball can play a large roll in outcomes

As such, success rates of predictions are low relative to predictions in other sports, e.g. in Football, Tennis, Horse Racing etc.  This is reflected by the high odds that one can get from bookmakers - favorites typically come in around 6-12/1, midrange players around 20-80/1 and the rest can vary from 100-1000/1

- Goal:

Make score and head-to-head predictions using the latest ML & AI techniques.  These will be baselined against historical odds betting data to determine whether or not models can match / beat experts.
